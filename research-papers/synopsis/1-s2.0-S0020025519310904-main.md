## Recommending Investors for New Startups: Integrating Network Diffusion and Domain Preference 

This paper tackles the cold-start problem in investor recommendation for startups, where new companies lack investment history and traditional bipartite network-based recommendation approaches fail.  The authors propose using a tripartite network representation, integrating investors, companies, and company domains (represented by tags).

**Key Findings:**

* **Investors exhibit strong domain preferences:** Investors tend to invest heavily in companies with a small number of preferred tags, indicating domain-specific investment focus.
* **Tripartite network representation with virtual links:** The authors introduce two new tripartite network representations:
    * **Company-tag-investor (CTI):** Companies are connected to their tags, and tags are virtually linked to investors based on investment history.
    * **Company-investor-tag (CIT):** Similar to CTI, but investors are connected to companies, and companies are linked to tags. 
* **Diffusion-based recommendation algorithms:** The Probs algorithm, based on probabilistic spreading, is applied to these tripartite networks. This algorithm assigns an initial resource to the target startup's tags, which then spreads through the network, revealing potential investors with higher resource values.
* **Performance comparison:** The Probs algorithm on the weighted CIT network significantly outperforms the traditional tag-company-investor (TCI) representation and benchmark algorithms, including:
    * **Popularity-based:** Recommending investors based on their number of previous investments.
    * **Tag-voting:** Scoring investors based on the number of companies they have invested in with specific tags of the target company.
    * **Normalized tag-voting:** Similar to tag-voting, but normalizes the score based on the total number of investments in companies with the same tag.
    * **Neighbor-based Collaborative Filtering:** Utilizes the similarity between the target company and other companies to recommend investors who have invested in similar companies.
    * **Matrix Factorization based on Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR-MF):** Learns latent features of investors and companies to predict investment probabilities. 

**Methodology:**

* **Dataset:** 34,469 investment events collected from www.itjuzi.com, containing information on investors, investee companies, tags, and timestamps.
* **Network construction:** Three tripartite network representations (TCI, CTI, CIT) are created, with the latter two incorporating virtual links between investors and tags.
* **Recommendation algorithms:** 
    * **Probs (Probabilistic Spreading):** Iterative process of resource distribution across the network.
    * **Heats (Heat Spreading):** Analogous to heat diffusion process.
* **Benchmark algorithms:**  Five algorithms (popularity-based, tag-voting, normalized tag-voting, neighbor-based CF, BPR-MF) are used for comparison.
* **Evaluation:** 
    * **Ranking Score (RS):** Measures the relative ranking of relevant investors in the recommended list.
    * **AUC (Area Under Curve):** Evaluates the ability to distinguish relevant from irrelevant investors.

**Results:**

* The Probs algorithm on the weighted CIT network consistently achieves the best performance in terms of RS and AUC, highlighting the effectiveness of leveraging virtual links and domain preference in investor recommendation. 
* The Probs algorithm outperforms the Heats algorithm and all benchmark methods, emphasizing the importance of tripartite networks and diffusion processes for cold-start scenarios.
* The computational efficiency of the Probs algorithm on the weighted CIT network is comparable to other methods, suggesting practical feasibility.

**Conclusions:**

The study presents a novel approach to investor recommendation for startups, leveraging tripartite networks with virtual links and diffusion-based algorithms. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, particularly in addressing the cold-start problem. The findings have significant implications for venture capital, entrepreneurship, and the broader recommender systems field.

**Future Directions:**

* Incorporating temporal information to capture evolving investor preferences.
* Testing the methodology on a wider range of investment datasets.
* Exploring additional factors like financial considerations, product/market characteristics, and social relations to enhance recommendation accuracy.
