## Specialist versus Generalist Investors: Trading off Support Quality, Investment Horizon, and Control Rights

This paper models an entrepreneur's decision between selecting an active (specialist) or passive (generalist) investor for an innovative venture requiring external equity. The specialist investor offers better support but has a shorter investment horizon than the generalist. The paper focuses on the entrepreneur's contract design to maximize the venture's Net Present Value (NPV), considering the specialist's potential moral hazard: they might sell their claim in a secondary transaction to an uninformed outside investor even when the project is unsuccessful.

**Key Concepts & Definitions:**

* **Generalist Investor:** A long-term investor with no specific industry expertise, providing funding throughout the venture's life cycle.
* **Specialist Investor:** A "hands-on" investor, typically a seed-stage venture capitalist, offering expertise and active support but with a shorter investment horizon.
* **Moral Hazard:**  The risk that an investor might act in their self-interest, potentially harming the venture's success, especially when their information is asymmetric.
* **Net Present Value (NPV):** The discounted value of future cash flows minus the initial investment, representing the project's profitability.
* **Liquidation Preference:** A provision in the contract giving the investor priority over liquidation proceeds, minimizing their loss in case of failure.
* **Control Rights:** The power to make key decisions about the venture, such as liquidation, influencing the project's path.

**The Model:**

* **Two-Period Project:**  Requires seed capital (I₀) and expansion capital (I₁) at different stages.
* **State of Nature:**  Determines the project's success at the interim stage (t=1), either favorable or unfavorable.
* **Effort (e):** The entrepreneur's effort, positively correlated with the probability of reaching a favorable state, but costly (c * e²/2).
* **Support:** Investors provide support (monitoring and advice) impacting the cost of effort (cG for generalist, cS for specialist with cS < cG).
* **Secondary Transaction:**  The specialist investor sells their claim to an uninformed expansion investor at t=1.
* **Control Allocation:** Determines who (entrepreneur or investor) holds the majority of board seats and has the decision power to liquidate.

**Main Findings:**

* **Optimal Contracts:** The paper derives optimal contracts for both investor types under different control allocations, maximizing the entrepreneur's NPV.
* **Inefficient Continuation:**  The specialist investor with control rights may inefficiently continue the venture in its unfavorable state, selling a "lemon" due to their short-term horizon.
* **Trade-offs:**  The entrepreneur faces trade-offs between support quality (specialist) and efficient liquidation (generalist), as well as control rights and the incentive to liquidate.
* **Control Allocation:** While control rights typically favor investors to prevent hold-ups, the paper shows that under certain conditions, it might be beneficial to grant control to the entrepreneur.
* **Liquidation Preference:** The standard practice of full liquidation preferences for investors might not be optimal, as it incentivizes inefficient continuation. Sharing liquidation proceeds can improve efficiency but may lead to shirking.

**Empirical Predictions:**

* **Secondary Market:**  The model explains the growth of secondary transactions as a way for specialist investors to gain liquidity and showcase successful track records.
* **Contract Structure:**  More sophisticated specialist investors might choose to grant a share of liquidation proceeds to entrepreneurs, balancing the potential for shirking with increased NPV.
* **Riskier Investments:**  Specialist investors, facing pressure to exit, might engage in riskier investments towards the end of their fund's lifecycle.

**Overall Methodology:**

The paper utilizes a two-stage game-theoretic model with backward induction to analyze the optimal contracts and decision-making processes. It focuses on maximizing the entrepreneur's NPV, taking into account the incentives and constraints of both investor types. The model is then used to generate testable empirical predictions about the behavior of investors and the structure of entrepreneurial finance contracts.

**Limitations:**

* The paper assumes a competitive market with full bargaining power for the entrepreneur, which might not always be realistic.
* The model does not consider potential non-pecuniary benefits for the entrepreneur in continuing the venture.
* Syndication of investors is not included, preventing an analysis of combining the advantages of both generalist and specialist investors.

**Contributions:**

This paper adds to the existing literature on entrepreneurial finance by:

* Modeling the trade-offs between support quality, investment horizon, and control rights in venture capital financing.
* Showing that granting control to the entrepreneur might be beneficial in certain situations.
* Providing a theoretical explanation for the growing secondary market and its potential impact on investment decisions.
* Highlighting the potential for a more nuanced approach to liquidation preferences in venture capital contracts.

**Further Research:**

* Incorporating the probability of unobservable exit requirements.
* Modeling the impact of syndication of generalist and specialist investors.
* Analyzing the effects of different contractual structures beyond liquidation preferences.
