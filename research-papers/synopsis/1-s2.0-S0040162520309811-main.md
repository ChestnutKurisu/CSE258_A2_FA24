## Geographic Distance, Venture Capital, and Technological Performance: Evidence from Chinese Enterprises

This paper investigates the relationship between geographic distance and the technological performance of VC-backed enterprises in China. It specifically examines how this relationship is affected by the VC's equity backgrounds (governmental, private, and foreign) and investment strategies (independent and joint).

**Literature Review:**

* Existing research shows VC plays a crucial role in technological innovation by providing capital, expertise, and networks. 
* Geographic proximity benefits VC institutions by reducing information asymmetry, transaction costs, and oversight difficulties, but its impact on enterprise technological performance is underexplored. 

**Theoretical Framework:**

* **VC Investments and Innovation:** VCs can bridge the "valley of death" for entrepreneurial enterprises by providing capital and value-added services, facilitating access to knowledge and resources, and mitigating risks associated with information asymmetry.
* **Geographic Distance and Technological Performance:** Increased geographic distance leads to higher information asymmetry, increased transaction costs, and reduced oversight efficiency, potentially negatively affecting enterprise technological performance.

**Hypotheses:**

* **H1:** The influence of geographic distance on technological performance varies across VC equity backgrounds (GVC, PVC, FVC).
* **H2:** Different VC strategies (JVC, IVC) result in distinct impacts of geographic distance on technological performance.
* **H3:** Geographic distance has a nonlinear effect on the technological performance of VC-backed enterprises.

**Methodology:**

* **Data:** The study uses a panel dataset of 345 GEM-listed enterprises in China from 2010 to 2017, identifying VC-backed enterprises based on shareholder information. 
* **Variables:**
    * **Dependent Variable:** Technological performance, measured by the number of patent applications (logarithmized) and R&D investment (ratio of R&D expenditure to operating income).
    * **Independent Variables:**
        * VC (dummy variable)
        * Geographic distance (calculated using the Haversine formula)
        * VC Equity Background (GVC, PVC, FVC)
        * VC Investment Strategy (JVC, IVC)
    * **Control Variables:** Enterprise size, age, asset growth rate, equity ratio, industry category, and enterprise location.
* **Models:**
    * **Regression Analysis:** To examine the linear effects of geographic distance on technological performance and the interaction effects with VC equity backgrounds and strategies.
    * **Panel Threshold Model:** To analyze the nonlinear effect of geographic distance on technological performance using the Hansen (1999) model. 

**Empirical Results:**

* **Heterogeneity of VC Equity Backgrounds:** Geographic distance negatively impacts technological performance for all VC equity backgrounds, with a more significant impact on GVC-backed enterprises. 
* **Heterogeneity of VC Investment Strategies:** Geographic distance negatively impacts technological performance for both JVC and IVC, with a stronger impact on IVC.
* **Nonlinear Effects:**  A nonlinear relationship exists between geographic distance and technological performance, with a significant negative impact when distance is below a threshold (470.73 km and 1050.71 km), and no significant impact when above the threshold.
* **Robustness Tests:**  The results hold when replacing the dependent variable with R&D investment, using alternative measures of VC, and addressing endogeneity through a two-stage strategy and PSM method.

**Discussions and Conclusions:**

* **Key Findings:** Geographic distance has a nonlinear negative impact on technological performance of VC-backed enterprises, with greater influence on GVC-backed enterprises and IVC-backed enterprises.
* **Implications for Policymakers:** Government policies should prioritize attracting geographically close GVC and PVC institutions, encouraging joint investment strategies, and promoting the inflow of leading FVC institutions.
* **Implications for Enterprises:** Enterprises should prioritize VC institutions that are geographically close, especially GVC and PVC, and consider engaging in joint investment strategies.

**Limitations and Future Research:**

* The study focuses on GEM-listed enterprises, neglecting SMEs that are not publicly traded.
* Future research should explore the influence of other factors, such as high-speed rail networks, e-communication, and VC platforms, on technological performance.
* The study does not investigate the impact of geographic diversity in CVC investment portfolios on technological performance.

**Overall:** The paper provides valuable insights into the complex relationship between geographic distance, VC characteristics, and technological performance in the Chinese context. It highlights the importance of considering VC equity backgrounds and investment strategies when evaluating the impact of geographic distance on enterprise innovation. Further research is needed to deepen our understanding of these relationships and inform policymakers and enterprises in China.
