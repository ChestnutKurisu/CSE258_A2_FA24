## Research on Decision-Making of Complex Venture Capital Based on Financial Big Data Platform: A Detailed Summary

This paper proposes a financial big data platform combined with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) for predicting stock premiums, aiding venture capital decision-making and financial risk investment. 

**1. Introduction:**

* **Problem:** Predicting stock premiums is crucial for companies to make informed financial risk investments and avoid failures. Traditional algorithms struggle with the massive volume and time-series nature of financial big data.
* **Solution:** This paper proposes a real-time stock premium prediction model based on LSTM on a financial big data platform.

**2. Financial Big Data Platform:**

* **Characteristics:**
    * **Infinite:** Constant generation of data in financial markets.
    * **Time series:** Data is generated sequentially with a timestamp.
    * **Real-time:** Data arrives at specific time nodes.
    * **Unpredictable:** Stock prices are influenced by numerous factors.
* **Key Technologies:**
    * **Theme Crawler:** Extracts financial data from websites by targeting specific topics.
    * **jsoup Page Parsing:** Parses HTML webpages and extracts relevant information.
    * **Solr Search:**  A high-speed search engine for efficient search in large datasets.
    * **Hadoop Architecture:** Provides distributed storage (HDFS) and computation (MapReduce) for massive data.
* **Platform Architecture:**
    * **Computing Center:** Performs streaming and distributed computations, manages tasks, and provides algorithm libraries.
    * **Data Center:** Stores, indexes, and manages data (structured and unstructured).
    * **Collection Center:** Collects and integrates data from various sources.
    * **Dispatch Center:** Manages tasks, schedules resources, and balances load.
    * **Application Center:** Provides applications based on the platform (data collection, financial product topic analysis, research reports).
    * **Open Center:** Enables external platforms to access data.

**3. Data and Preprocessing:**

* **Data Acquisition:**  Monthly equity premiums, book-to-market ratio (b/m), net equity expansion (ntis), cross-sectional premium (csp) data between 1947 and 2015.
* **Data Structure Analysis:**  Independent variables exhibit large fluctuations, necessitating normalization.
* **Bootstrap Resampling:**
    * **Principle:** Simulates large samples from a small dataset without assumptions.
    * **Process:** 
        1. Split the data into blocks.
        2. Randomly extract blocks with replacement.
        3. Combine extracted blocks to form resampled data.
* **Data Preprocessing with Block Bootstrap:**
    * **Addressing Dependency:**  Preserves dependent structures in time-series data.
    * **Block Extraction:**  Extracts entire blocks for resampling, preserving relationships.
    * **Resampling:**  Similar to standard bootstrap but applied to blocks.

**4. Real-Time Forecasting Model of Equity Premium Based on LSTM:**

* **LSTM Internal Structure:**
    * **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN):** Powerful models for sequential data, but suffer from vanishing gradients, making long-term dependencies difficult to learn.
    * **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory):**  Overcomes vanishing gradients by introducing memory blocks:
        * **Memory Cells:** Accumulate state information over time.
        * **Gates:** Control the flow of information (input gate, output gate, forget gate).
    * **LSTM Equations:** Define the mathematical operations within a memory block during forward and backward propagation.
* **LSTM Network Design:**
    * **Two-Layer Network:**  Illustrates the architecture of a multi-layer LSTM model.
    * **Parameters:** NeuralNums (number of neurons), timeStep (sequence length), dropout (regularization), loss function (MSE), optimizer (Adam), activation function (tanh), output_dim (number of outputs), epochs (training iterations), batch_size.

**5. Result Analysis and Investment Strategies:**

* **LSTM vs. SVR:**  LSTM outperforms Support Vector Machine Regression (SVR) in predicting stock premiums, exhibiting higher accuracy and stability.
* **Evaluation Metrics:**
    * **SSE (Sum of Squared Errors):** Measures the total prediction error. Lower SSE indicates better model fit.
    * **R-Square:**  Indicates the proportion of variance explained by the model. Values closer to 1 suggest stronger explanatory power.
* **Investment Strategies:**
    * **Based on SSE and R-Square:** 
        * **Sell:** If both SSE and R-Square are below a threshold.
        * **Buy:** If both SSE and R-Square are above a threshold.
        * **Hold:** If either indicator is below the threshold.
    * **Future Improvements:** Utilizing particle swarm optimization or ant colony optimization to automatically tune LSTM parameters.

**6. Conclusion:**

* **Financial Big Data Platform:**  Provides a powerful infrastructure for data collection, storage, and processing.
* **Block Bootstrap:**  Improves data preprocessing for time-series data by preserving dependencies.
* **LSTM:**  A highly effective model for stock premium prediction, exhibiting superior performance compared to SVR.
